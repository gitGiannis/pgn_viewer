# PGN Viewer
My first project using python(3).
## About
Simple application that represents chess games in a simple 2D gui board
using the tkinter lib.
Search local pgn files and select the game you want to watch
from the main window.
After a selection is made, a new window is opened with the board and various
information about the game.
You can then watch the game by going forward and backwards through the moves.
### Dependencies
